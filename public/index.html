        <h3>Data Mining & Information Comparison</h3>
        <p class="skill1">I have a degree in Industrial Production Engineering, however I have barely been inside a
            factory, instead I
            started my career in the financial market working basically with data mining and information comparisons. I
            worked for big companies in Brazil, including B3 Stock Exchange, a Brazil based financial market structure
            provider, consider the 13th stock exchanger in the world. Working with data mining I had the opportunity to
            get to know a bit of SQL, and also run software applications tests. </p>
